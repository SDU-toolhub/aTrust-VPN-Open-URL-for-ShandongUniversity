# aTrust-VPN-Open-URL

The SDU new VPN provided by aTrust is very hard to use with lots of bugs. This script can help to make it easier to use. For Windows users only.

## BEFORE YOU RUN THE SCRIPT

DO make sure the VPN service is working. YOU MUST INSTALL aTrust client and run it.

If you do not want to use the GUI or have other problems:

open `taskmgr.exe` or `services.msc` and run the aTrustService

open https://vpn.sdu.edu.cn/portal/#!/login

login.

If the login is successful, the browser will show the aTrust dashboard, which is in fact, hard to use.

Now you can use this script. Download the code from here or Release page and double-click to run the VBS script.

You can try opening `https://ip8.com`. Your IP address should be in Jinan, China.

Enjoy using!
