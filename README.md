# aTrust-VPN-Open-URL
The SDU new VPN provided by aTrust is very hard to use with lots of bugs. This script can help to make it easier to use.

## BEFORE YOU RUN THE SCRIPT

DO make sure the VPN service is working.

If you do not want to use the GUI:

open taskmgr.exe and run the aTrustService

open https://tvpn.sdu.edu.cn/portal/#!/login

login

Then run the script. Enjoy using!

If you have a GitHub Account, give me a star if you like it.
